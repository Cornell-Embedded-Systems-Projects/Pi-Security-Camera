## Running the Camera
After everything is set up, connect to your Raspberry Pi's terminal. If you have an HDMI monitor and a USB mouse/keyboard set, feel free to connect the pi to your monitor and find the terminal icon. Another method for remotely connecting is SSH, or Secure SHell. A guide is provided on the Raspberry Pi website: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/
